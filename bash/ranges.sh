# Brace Expansion {...}
# used to generate arbitrary strings:
echo {1..10} # => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
echo {a..z} # => a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# This will output the range from the start value to the end value.
# Note that you can't use variables here:
from=1
to=10
echo {$from..$to} # => {$from..$to}

# Now that we know how to echo and use variables,
# let's learn some of the other basics of Bash!

# Our current directory is available through the command `pwd`.
# `pwd` stands for "print working directory".
# We can also use the built-in variable `$PWD`.
# Observe that the following are equivalent:
echo "I'm in $(pwd)" # execs `pwd` and interpolates output
echo "I'm in $PWD" # interpolates the variable
